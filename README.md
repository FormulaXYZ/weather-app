## Description

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. I built
this weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.Third-party APIs allow developers
to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.I used [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)
to retrieve weather data for cities.
